# Halloween22_Eyeball

This contains the code for the different stages of my Halloween project for 2022. Blog post here: https://lorraine.mcunderwood.org/halloween-2022-tracking-eyeball/

# Stage1 #
I got pygame to display an eyeball and a moving iris using the keyboard keys. Runs on any computer with python and pygame installed

# Stage2 #
I got an eyelid to close whenever the up key was pressed

# Stage3 (incoming) 
is to transfer all to a raspberry pi with camera and have the eyeball reacting to people moving, not keys
